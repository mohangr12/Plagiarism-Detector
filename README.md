# Plagiarism-Detector
As we know Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict, and control the observed phenomenon. So as the interest in research is growing so to write the research paper it is important to be original and some people just copy the research so I created a program in which you can give source and target file and can get the percentage of the plagiarism. This uses an n-Gram algorithm and is helpful for research scholars.
